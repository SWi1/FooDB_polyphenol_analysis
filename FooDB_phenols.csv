In normal non-alcoholic subjects and alcoholics, Salsolinol and O-methylated Salsolinol were found in urine, cerebrospinal fluid and brains. Salsolinol has an asymmetric center at first position and exists as (R)- and (S)enantiomer. The (R)enantiomer of Salsolinol is predominant in urine from healthy volunteers. Only the (R)enantiomers of Salsolinol and N-methylated Salsolinol occur in the human brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and intraventricular fluid (IVF), and the (S)enantiomers were not detected. (R)salsolinol synthase catalyzes the enantio-selective synthesis of (R)Salsolinol and 1-carboxyl(R)Salsolinol from dopamine with acetaldehyde or pyruvic acid. The N-methylation of (R)salsolinol into N-methylsalsolinol (NMSal) is catalyzed by two N-methyltransferases with different optimum pH, at pH 7.0 and 8.4. NM(R)Salsolinol is enzymatically oxidized into 1,2-dimethyl-6,7-dihydroxyisoquinolinium ion (DMDHIQ+) by an oxidase sensitive to semicarbaside and also non-enzymatically by autoxidation.

The presence of hydroquinone in normal individuals stems mainly from direct dietary ingestion, catabolism of tyrosine and other substrates by gut bacteria, ingestion of arbutin containing foods, cigarette smoking, and the use of some over-the-counter medicines. Hydroquinone is a white granular solid at room temperature and pressure. The hydroxyl groups of hydroquinone are quite weakly acidic. Hydroquinone can lose an H+ from one of the hydroxyls to form a monophenolate ion or lose an H+ from both to form a diphenolate ion. Hydroquinone has a variety of uses principally associated with its action as a reducing agent which is soluble in water. It is a major component in most photographic developers where, with the compound Metol, it reduces silver halides to elemental silver. [HMDB].

Erythrosine is commonly used in sweets such as some candies and popsicles, and even more widely used in cake-decorating gels. While commonly used in many countries of the world, erythrosine is less commonly used in the United States because Allura Red AC (Red #40) is generally used instead. However, Allura Red AC is banned in many European countries solely because it is an azo dye, despite scientific consensus of Red 40 having fewer known health risks.

Tannins are astringent, bitter-tasting plant polyphenols that bind and precipitate proteins. The term tannin refers to the source of tannins used in tanning animal hides into leather; however, the term is widely applied to any large polyphenolic compound containing sufficient hydroxyls and other suitable groups (such as carboxyls) to form strong complexes with proteins and other macromolecules. Tannins have molecular weights ranging from 500 to over 3,000. Tannins are usually divided into hydrolyzable tannins and condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins). At the center of a hydrolyzable tannin molecule, there is a polyol carbohydrate (usually D-glucose). The hydroxyl groups of the carbohydrate are partially or totally esterified with phenolic groups such as gallic acid (in gallotannins) or ellagic acid (in ellagitannins). Hydrolyzable tannins are hydrolyzed by weak acids or weak bases to produce carbohydrate and phenolic acids. Condensed tannins, also known as proanthocyanidins, are polymers of 2 to 50 (or more) flavonoid units that are joined by carbon-carbon bonds, which are not susceptible to being cleaved by hydrolysis. While hydrolyzable tannins and most condensed tannins are water soluble, some very large condensed tannins are insoluble. Tannins may be employed medicinally in antidiarrheal, hemostatic, and antihemorrhoidal compoundsand is also, they produce different colors with ferric chloride (either blue, blue black, or green to greenish black) according to the type of tannin. Examples of gallotannins are the gallic acid esters of glucose in tannic acid (C76H52O46), found in the leaves and bark of many plant species. Foods with tannins include tea, wine and some fruits .

Enterolactone is a mammalian lignan that have a similar biphenolic structure to lignans from plants. Lignans are compounds with estrogenic properties and are probably the most important source of phytoestrogens in western diets. Mammalian lignans are formed from precursors that are contained mainly in vegetables, whole grain products and berries, via action of intestinal microflora. Enterolactone is produced in the colon by the action of bacteria on  secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol and its glycosides. Secoisolariciresinol is converted to enterodiol which is subsequently converted to enterolactone as it passes through the colon. Matairesinol is converted directly to enterolactone. Enterolactone have been shown to possess weakly estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities, and it has been suggested that the high production of this antiestrogenic mammalian lignans in the gut may serve to protect against breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men; however epidemiological evidence to date is conflicting. (PMID: 16168401, 12270221, 11216511, 12107024). Enterolactone is a biomarker for the consumption of soy beans and other soy products.

Nutriceutical with anticancer and bone protective props.

Daidzein is one of several known isoflavones. Isoflavones compounds are found in a number of plants, but soybeans and soy products like tofu and textured vegetable protein are the primary food source. Up until recently, daidzein was considered to be one of the most important and most studied isoflavones, however more recently attention has shifted to isoflavone metabolites. Equol represents the main active product of daidzein metabolism, produced via specific microflora in the gut. The clinical effectiveness of soy isoflavones may be a function of the ability to biotransform soy isoflavones to the more potent estrogenic metabolite, equol, which may enhance the actions of soy isoflavones, owing to its greater affinity for estrogen receptors, unique antiandrogenic properties, and superior antioxidant activity. However, not all individuals consuming daidzein produce equol. Only approximately one-third to one-half of the population is able to metabolize daidzein to equol. This high variability in equol production is presumably attributable to interindividual differences in the composition of the intestinal microflora, which may play an important role in the mechanisms of action of isoflavones. But, the specific bacterial species in the colon involved in the production of equol are yet to be discovered. (PMID: 18045128, 17579894, Curr Med Chem. 2007;14(26):2824-30., Mol Nutr Food Res. 2007 Jul;51(7):765-81.) Daidzein is a biomarker for the consumption of soy beans and other soy products.

Petunidin is an anthocyanin.; Anthocyanins are water soluble pigments belonging to the flavonoids compound family involved in nature in a wide range of functions such as flowers, fruits, and seeds pigmentation to attract pollinators, to disperse seeds, to protect against UV light damage, and in plant defense to protect against pathogen attack.  Because anthocyanins impart much of the color and flavor of fruits and vegetables, they are usually components of the human diet and are not only considered exclusively as food products but also as therapeutic agents; in fact, anthocyanins have been suggested to protect against oxidative stress, coronary heart diseases, certain cancers, and other age-related diseases. At least part of these presumed health-promoting features can be attributed to the antioxidant properties of these compounds whose chemical structure appears ideal for free radical scavenging.

Coumestrol is a natural organic compound in the class of phytochemicals known as coumestans. It has garnered research interest because of its estrogenic activity and its prevalence in some foods, such as soybeans and herbs such as Pueraria mirifica.; Coumestrol is a phytoestrogen, mimicking the biological activity of estrogens. The chemical shape of coumestrol orients its two hydroxy groups in the same position as the two hydroxy groups in estradiol, allowing it to inhibit the activity of aromatase and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. These enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, and inhibition of these enzymes results in the modulation of hormone production.; Coumestrol, a coumestan isoflavone, has estrogenic properties (phytoestrogens are compounds structurally and functionally similar to 17-estradiol) and is an isoflavonoid phytoalexin produced by soybeans, a low molecular weight antimicrobial compound that is synthesized de novo and accumulates in plants after exposure to microorganisms (i.e.: phytoalexin induction and accumulation in soybean cotyledon tissue is observed with four species of Aspergillus: A. sojae, A. oryzae, A. niger, and A. flavus.). (PMID: 10888516); Coumestrol is a naturally occurring plant coumarin that displays high affinity for the hormone-binding site of the human estrogen receptor (hER), for which it serves as a potent non-steroidal agonist. Coumestrol emits intense blue fluorescence when bound to this protein, making it ideally suited for use as a cytological stain to detect ER in fixed and intact cells. Such observations illustrate the potential for using coumestrol to investigate real-time effects of a variety of physiological stimuli on the subcellular distribution of hER in living cells. (PMID: 8315272). Coumestrol is found in many foods, some of which are green bean, miso, other soy product, and fruits.","479-13-0","OC1=CC2=C(C=C1)C1=C(O2)C2=C(OC1=O)C=C(O)C=C2","InChI=1S/C15H8O5/c16-7-1-3-9-11(5-7)19-14-10-4-2-8(17)6-12(10)20-15(18)13(9)14/h1-6,16-17H",268.0371734,"ZZIALNLLNHEQPJ-UHFFFAOYSA-N","5,14-dihydroxy-8,17-dioxatetracyclo[8.7.0.0²,⁷.0¹¹,¹⁶]heptadeca-1(10),2(7),3,5,11,13,15-heptaen-9-one","Organic compounds","Phenylpropanoids and polyketides","Isoflavonoids","Coumestans"

Bisdemethoxycurcumin is a curcuminoid, a component of tumeric. Tumeric is a spice that comes from the root Curcuma longa, a member of the ginger family, Zingaberaceae. It is bright yellow and has been used as a coloring agent in food in the United States. In India, it has been used for centuries as a spice and a food preservative, and also for its various medicinal properties. In Ayurveda (Indian traditional medicine), tumeric has been used for its medicinal properties for various indications and through different routes of administration. It has been used topically on the skin for wounds, blistering diseases such as pemphigus and herpes zoster, for parasitic skin infections, and for acne. It has been used via oral administration for the common cold, liver diseases, urinary tract diseases, and as a blood purifier. For chronic rhinitis and coryza, it has been used via inhalation. The average intake of tumeric in the diet in India is approximately 2 to 2.5 g in a 60 kg individual. This corresponds to an intake of approximately 60 to 100 mg of curcumin daily. The Food and Drug Administration has classified tumeric among substances Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). A large number of in vitro and animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of curcumin on inflammation. It has been found to act at various different levels of the arachadonic acid inflammatory cascade and through effects on various enzymes and cytokines. (PMID: 12676044) [HMDB].

In addition to its physiologic immune function as an acute stress cytokine, sustained elevated expression levels of IL6 promote chronic inflammatory disorders, aging frailty, and tumorigenesis.

In model 2, contains at least two galloyl units C-C coupled to each other, and do not contain a glycosidically linked catechin unit. Pedunculagin is slightly soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Pedunculagin can be found in a number of food items such as cloves, rubus (blackberry, raspberry), red raspberry, and guava, which makes pedunculagin a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products.

Aloin extracted from natural sources is a mixture of two diastereomers, termed aloin A (also called barbaloin) and aloin B (or isobarbaloin), which have similar chemical properties. Aloin is an anthraquinone glycoside, meaning that its anthraquinone skeleton has been modified by the addition of a sugar molecule. Anthraquinones are a common family of naturally occurring yellow, orange, and red pigments of which many have cathartic properties, attributes shared by aloin. Aloin is related to aloe emodin, which lacks a sugar group but shares aloin's biological properties.; Aloin, also known as Barbaloin [Reynolds, Aloes - The genus Aloe, 2004], is a bitter, yellow-brown colored compound noted in the exudate of at least 68 Aloe species at levels from 0.1 to 6.6% of leaf dry weight (making between 3% and 35% of the toal exudate) (Groom &amp; Reynolds, 1987), and in another 17 species at indeterminate levels [Reynolds, 1995b]. It is used as a stimulant-laxative, treating constipation by inducing bowel movements. The compound is present in what is commonly referred to as the aloe latex that exudes from cells adjacent to the vascular bundles, found under the rind of the leaf and in between it and the gel. When dried, it has been used as a bittering agent in commerce (alcoholic beverages) [21 CFR 172.510. Scientific names given include Aloe perryi, A. barbadensis (= A. vera), A. ferox, and hybrids of A. ferox with A. africana and A. spicata.]. Aloe is listed in federal regulations as a natural substance that may be ?safely used in food? when used ?in the minimum quantity required to produce their intended physical or technical effect and in accordance with all the principles of good manufacturing practice.? This food application is generally limited to use in quite small quantities as a flavoring in alcoholic beverages and may usually be identified only as a ?natural flavor.?; In May 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a ruling that aloe laxatives are no longer generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and effective, meaning that aloin-containing products are no longer available in over-the-counter drug products in the United States. Aloe vera leaf latex is a concentrate of an herb or other botanical, and so meets the statutory description of an ingredient that may be used in dietary supplements.","8015-61-0","OCC1OC(C(O)C(O)C1O)C1C2=C(C(O)=CC=C2)C(=O)C2=C1C=C(CO)C=C2O","InChI=1S/C21H22O9/c22-6-8-4-10-14(21-20(29)19(28)17(26)13(7-23)30-21)9-2-1-3-11(24)15(9)18(27)16(10)12(25)5-8/h1-5,13-14,17,19-26,28-29H,6-7H2",418.1263823,"AFHJQYHRLPMKHU-UHFFFAOYSA-N","1,8-dihydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-10-[3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-2-yl]-9,10-dihydroanthracen-9-one","","","",""

Phloroglucinol is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Phloroglucinol can be found in a number of food items such as garden onion, tea, soft-necked garlic, and tarragon, which makes phloroglucinol a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products. Phloroglucinol can be found primarily in feces. Phloroglucinol is an organic compound that is used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and explosives.

Carnosol is a naturally occurring phenolic diterpene found in rosemary (Rosemarinus officinalis, Labiatae). It has been known that an extract of rosemary leaves contains high antioxidative activity. Ninety percent of this antioxidative activity can be attributed to carnosol and carnosic acid. Carnosic acid is easily converted to carnosol by oxidation. Carnosol has multiple beneficial medicinal effects including anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-cancer activities in various disease models. Carnosol may possess important neuroprotective effects against rotenone-induced DA neuronal damage. Naturally occurring antioxidants reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, carnosol and carnosic acid promoted the synthesis of nerve growth factor in glial cells. Carnosol-mediated neuroprotection in DA neurons is involved in the attenuation of caspase-3 activity, which was induced by rotenone. Furthermore, carnosol-mediated tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) increase, which is dependent on the Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling pathway, is responsible for the neuroprotection in SN4741 DA cells. (PMID: 17047462); Carnosol, a phenolic diterpene compound of the labiate herbs rosemary and sage, is an  activator of the human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a ligand activated transcription factor, belonging to the metazoan family of nuclear hormone receptors. Activation of PPARgamma increases the transcription of enzymes involved in primary metabolism, leading to lower blood levels of fatty acids and glucose. Hence, PPARgamma represents the major target for the glitazone type of drugs currently being used clinically for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Malvidin (Mv) is an anthocyanidin. As a primary plant pigment, its glycosides are highly abundant in nature. It is primarily responsible for the color of red wine, Vitis vinifera being one of its sources. It is also one of the anthocyanidins responsible for the blue pigment found in the Primula polyanthus plant.; Malvidin is an anthocyanin.  Anthocyanins are pigments that give color red to red grape (Vitis vinifera) varieties, and blood oranges (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck). (PMID: 15563216, 17425943); Anthocyanins have potentially chemopreventive activity, apart from its antioxidant activity. (PMID: 16080535); Numerous classes of grape anthocyanins are transferred to the wine and confer taste and color to the beverage. (PMID: 15954164); Anthocyanins are water soluble pigments belonging to the flavonoids compound family involved in nature in a wide range of functions such as flowers, fruits, and seeds pigmentation to attract pollinators, to disperse seeds, to protect against UV light damage, and in plant defense to protect against pathogen attack.  Because anthocyanins impart much of the color and flavor of fruits and vegetables, they are usually components of the human diet and are not only considered exclusively as food products but also as therapeutic agents; in fact, anthocyanins have been suggested to protect against oxidative stress, coronary heart diseases, certain cancers, and other age-related diseases. At least part of these presumed health-promoting features can be attributed to the antioxidant properties of these compounds whose chemical structure appears ideal for free radical scavenging.

Grandinin is soluble (in water) and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). Grandinin can be found in guava, which makes grandinin a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product. Grandinin is an ellagitannin. It can be found in Melaleuca quinquenervia leaves and in oaks species like the North American white oak (Quercus alba) and European red oak (Quercus robur). It shows antioxydant activity. It is an astringent compound. It is also found in wine, red or white, aged in oak barrels .","115166-32-0","OC1COC(O)(C(O)C1O)C1C2OC(=O)C3=C(C(O)=C(O)C(O)=C13)C1=C3C(=C(O)C(O)=C1O)C1=C(C=C(O)C(O)=C1O)C(=O)OC1COC(=O)C4=C(C(O)=C(O)C(O)=C4)C4=C(C=C(O)C(O)=C4O)C(=O)OC1C2OC3=O","InChI=1S/C46H34O30/c47-9-1-6-14(28(55)24(9)51)15-7(2-10(48)25(52)29(15)56)43(67)74-37-13(5-71-41(6)65)73-42(66)8-3-11(49)26(53)30(57)16(8)17-20-18(32(59)35(62)31(17)58)19-21-22(34(61)36(63)33(19)60)23(38(75-45(21)69)39(37)76-44(20)68)46(70)40(64)27(54)12(50)4-72-46/h1-3,12-13,23,27,37-40,47-64,70H,4-5H2",1066.11349,"ZVFDKYBWZMATCT-UHFFFAOYSA-N","7,8,9,12,13,14,25,26,27,30,31,32,35,36,37-pentadecahydroxy-46-(2,3,4,5-tetrahydroxyoxan-2-yl)-3,18,21,41,43-pentaoxanonacyclo[27.13.3.1³⁸,⁴².0²,²⁰.0⁵,¹⁰.0¹¹,¹⁶.0²³,²⁸.0³³,⁴⁵.0³⁴,³⁹]hexatetraconta-5(10),6,8,11(16),12,14,23(28),24,26,29,31,33(45),34(39),35,37-pentadecaene-4,17,22,40,44-pentone","","","",""

6,8-Dihydroxypurine is an endogenous nucleoside found in human fluids. Purine bases are present in higher amounts in tumor-bearing patients compared to healthy controls. DNA hypermethylation is a common finding in malignant cells and has been explored as a therapeutic target for hypomethylating agents. When chemical bonds to DNA, the DNA becomes damaged and proper and complete replication cannot occur to make the normal intended cell. A DNA adduct is an abnormal piece of DNA covalently-bonded to a cancer-causing chemical. This has shown to be the start of a cancerous cell, or carcinogenesis. DNA adducts in scientific experiments are used as bio-markers and as such are themselves measured to reflect quantitatively, for comparison, the amount of cancer in the subject.

Intestinal bacteria in humans can reduce daidzein to equol, and can be found in normal human urine. The clinical effectiveness of soy isoflavones may be a function of the ability to biotransform soy isoflavones to the more potent estrogenic metabolite, equol, which may enhance the actions of soy isoflavones, owing to its greater affinity for estrogen receptors, unique antiandrogenic properties, and superior antioxidant activity. However, not all individuals consuming daidzein produce equol. Only approximately one-third to one-half of the population is able to metabolize daidzein to equol. This high variability in equol production is presumably attributable to interindividual differences in the composition of the intestinal microflora, which may play an important role in the mechanisms of action of isoflavones.

This phenolic group appears to play an important role in determining the estrogenic agonist/antagonistic properties of these compounds. Phytoestrogens have been categorized according to their chemical structures as isoflavones, lignans and coumestans.

These suggests that GTP, ITP, and XTP are differential signal sorters and signal amplifiers at the G-protein level. G-proteins mediate signal transfer from receptors to effector systems.

There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that these compounds are neurotoxic, and it has been recently hypothesized that neurodegenerative disorders may be associated with increased levels of this biogenic aldehyde. It is possible to speculate that reduced detoxification of 3,4- dihydroxymandelaldehyde from impaired or deficient aldehyde dehydrogenase function may be a contributing factor in the suggested neurotoxicity of these compounds.

Its use is now deprecated following introduction of alternative safer classes of agents. However it continues to have a role in otherwise difficult to treat hypertension and gestational hypertension (formerly known as pregnancy-induced hypertension).; Methyldopa is an aromatic-amino-acid decarboxylase inhibitor in animals and in man. Only methyldopa, the <i>L</i>-isomer of alpha-methyldopa, has the ability to inhibit dopa decarboxylase and to deplete animal tissues of norepinephrine. In man the antihypertensive activity appears to be due solely to the L-isomer. About twice the dose of the racemate (DL-alpha-methyldopa) is required for equal antihypertensive effect. Methyldopa has no direct effect on cardiac function and usually does not reduce glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, or filtration fraction. Cardiac output usually is maintained without cardiac acceleration. In some patients the heart rate is slowed. Normal or elevated plasma renin activity may decrease in the course of methyldopa therapy. Methyldopa reduces both supine and standing blood pressure. Methyldopa usually produces highly effective lowering of the supine pressure with infrequent symptomatic postural hypotension. Exercise hypotension and diurnal blood pressure variations rarely occur.; Methyldopa, in its active metabolite form, is a central alpha-2 receptor agonist. Using methyldopa leads to alpha-2 receptor-negative feedback to sympathetic nervous system (SNS) (centrally and peripherally), allowing peripheral sympathetic nervous system tone to decrease. Such activity leads to a decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR) and cardiac output.; When introduced it was a mainstay of antihypertensive therapy, but its use has declined, with increased use of other safer classes of agents. One of its important present-day uses is in the management of pregnancy-induced hypertension, as it is relatively safe in pregnancy compared to other antihypertensive drugs.

Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is an isoprenoid quinone that functions as an electron carrier in membranes. In eukaryotes ubiquinone is found mostly within the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it functions in respiratory electron transport, transferring two electrons from either complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) or complex II (succinate-ubiquinone reductase) to complex III (bc1 complex). The quinone nucleus of ubiquinone is derived directly from 4-hydroxybenzoate , while the isoprenoid subunits of the polyisoprenoid tail are synthesized via the methylerythritol phosphate pathway , which feeds isoprene units into the Polyprenyl Biosynthesis pathways. The number of isoprenoid subunits in the ubiquinone side chain vary in different species. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae subsp (S288c) has 6 such subunits, Escherichia coli K-12 has 8, rat and mouse have 9, and Homo sapiens has 10.

The Q cycle is a process that occurs in cytochrome b[, a component of Complex III in the electron transport chain,and that converts ubiquinol to ubiquinone in a cyclic fashion. When ubiquinol binds to cytochrome b, the pKa of the phenolic group decreases so that the proton ionizes and the phenoxide anion is formed (from wiki)

Ubiquinol-10, the reduced form of ubiquinone-10, efficiently scavenges free radicals generated chemically within liposomal membranes. Ubiquinol-10 is about as effective in preventing peroxidative damage to lipids as alpha-tocopherol, which is considered the best lipid-soluble antioxidant in humans. The number of radicals scavenged by each molecule of ubiquinol-10 is 1.1 under certain experimental conditions. In contrast to alpha-tocopherol, ubiquinol-10 is not recycled by ascorbate. However, it is known that ubiquinol-10 can be recycled by electron transport carriers present in various biomembranes and possibly by some enzymes. It is shown that ubiquinol-10 spares alpha-tocopherol when both antioxidants are present in the same liposomal membranes and that ubiquinol-10, like alpha-tocopherol, does not interact with reduced glutathione.It is suggested that ubiquinol-10 is an important physiological lipid-soluble antioxidant. [PMID: 2352956] [HMDB]. Ubiquinol-10 is found in many foods, some of which are sesbania flower, soursop, cherimoya, and fireweed.","5677-55-4","COC1=C(OC)C(O)=C(C\C=C(/C)CC\C=C(/C)CC\C=C(/C)CC\C=C(/C)CC\C=C(/C)CC\C=C(/C)CC\C=C(/C)CC\C=C(/C)CC\C=C(/C)CCC=C(C)C)C(C)=C1O","InChI=1S/C59H92O4/c1-44(2)24-15-25-45(3)26-16-27-46(4)28-17-29-47(5)30-18-31-48(6)32-19-33-49(7)34-20-35-50(8)36-21-37-51(9)38-22-39-52(10)40-23-41-53(11)42-43-55-54(12)56(60)58(62-13)59(63-14)57(55)61/h24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40,42,60-61H,15-23,25,27,29,31,33,35,37,39,41,43H2,1-14H3/b45-26+,46-28+,47-30+,48-32+,49-34+,50-36+,51-38+,52-40+,53-42+",864.6995614,"QNTNKSLOFHEFPK-UPTCCGCDSA-N","2-[(2E,6E,10E,14E,18E,22E,26E,30E,34E)-3,7,11,15,19,23,27,31,35,39-decamethyltetraconta-2,6,10,14,18,22,26,30,34,38-decaen-1-yl]-5,6-dimethoxy-3-methylbenzene-1,4-diol","Organic compounds","Lipids and lipid-like molecules","Prenol lipids","Quinone and hydroquinone lipids"
